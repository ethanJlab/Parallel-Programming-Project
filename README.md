# Parallel-Programming-Project

## How to run
- For each program run the command ``` g++ -o <name of executable>  <name of file>.cpp ``` to compile the source code
- Run the executable with the command ``` .\<name of executable>.exe ```

## TODO
- [x] Create "naive approach" function for fib sequence 
  - test this function with multiple values, get the time and final output
  - output will be standardised to ease data analysis

- [X] Create "naive approach w/ multithreading" function for fib 
  - test time and output

- [X] Create "memoization" function for fib 
  - test time and output
  
- [ ] Create "memoization w/ multithreading" function for fib 
  - test time and output

- [X] Create "Dynamic Programming" function for fib 
  - test time and output
  
- [X] Create "Fib with matrix" function for fib 
  - test time and output

- [ ] Create "Fib matrix with multi-threading" function
  - test time and output
